# OmniFocus MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates with OmniFocus to enable Claude (or other MCP-compatible AI assistants) to interact with your tasks and projects.

## 🌟 Overview

This MCP server creates a bridge between AI assistants (like Claude) and your OmniFocus task management system. It gives AI models the ability to view, create, edit, and remove tasks and projects in your OmniFocus database through natural language conversations.
Some ways you could use it:

- Translate the PDF of a syllabus into a fully specificed project with tasks, tags, defer dates, and due dates.
- Turn a meeting transcript into a list of actions
- Create visualizations of your tasks, projects, and tags
- Process multiple tasks or projects in a single operation
- Bulk manage your OmniFocus items efficiently


## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- macOS with OmniFocus installed
- Claude Desktop app

### Installation

1. Open Claude Desktop's configuration file:
   - Location: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - You can open it with: `open -e ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

2. Add the OmniFocus MCP server to the configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "omnifocus": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "omnifocus-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: If you already have other MCP servers configured, add the "omnifocus" entry to your existing "mcpServers" object.

3. Save the file and restart Claude Desktop

4. Verify the connection:
   - In Claude, you should see OmniFocus tools available
   - Try asking: "Can you see my OmniFocus tasks?"

### First-Time Setup

When you first use the OmniFocus MCP server:

1. **macOS will prompt for permissions**: You'll need to grant AppleScript access to OmniFocus
2. **Initial data load**: The first `dump_database` operation may take a moment for large databases
3. **Test the connection**: Ask Claude to show you a summary of your tasks to ensure everything is working

## 🌈 Use Cases

### Create Nested Task Structures

> "Create a 'Supermarket Shopping' task with these items as subtasks: Buy milk, Buy bread, Buy eggs, Buy vegetables."

The MCP server now supports nested tasks, allowing you to create hierarchical task structures that match OmniFocus's native capabilities.

### Find and Reference Tasks by ID

> "Show me the details of the task 'Review quarterly report'"
> "Create a subtask under task ID iKNpsVubKhG"

With ID visibility in `dump_database` and the new `get_task_details` tool, you can now:
- See task IDs directly in the database dump
- Look up any task by name to get its ID
- Use exact IDs for reliable parent-child relationships
- Avoid ambiguity when multiple tasks have similar names

### Reorganize your projects, tasks, and tags
> "I want every task to have an energy level tag. show me a list of all the tasks that don't have an energy level tag and your suggestions for what tag to add. I'll make any changes I think are appropriate. Then make the changes in OmniFocus."


### Add tasks from any conversation

> "Ok, thanks for the detailed explanation of why the rule of law is important. Add a recurring task to my activism project that reminds me to call my representative weekly. Include a summary of this conversation in the notes field."

### Quick, Virtual Perspectives

Get a summary of your current tasks and manage them conversationally:

> "Show me all my flagged tasks due this week that don't mention "fish".

### Process Transcripts or PDFs

Extract action items from meeting transcripts, academic research articles, or notes:

> "I'm pasting in the transcript from today's product meeting. Please analyze it and create tasks in OmniFocus for any action items assigned to me. Put them in my 'Product Development' project."

### Batch Operations

Manage multiple items efficiently:

> "I have a list of 20 tasks from this meeting transcript. Please add them all to my 'Q2 Planning' project with appropriate tags and due dates."

## 🛠 Development

### Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/themotionmachine/omnifocus-mcp-server.git
cd omnifocus-mcp-server
```

2. Install dependencies and build:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

3. Run the server locally:
```bash
npm start
# Or use the CLI wrapper:
node cli.cjs
```

### Using Your Local Version in Claude Desktop

To use your local development version instead of the npm package:

1. Update your Claude Desktop config to point to your local installation:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "omnifocus": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/omnifocus-mcp-server/cli.cjs"]
    }
  }
}
```

2. Restart Claude Desktop to use your local version

### Development Commands

```bash
npm run build    # Build TypeScript and copy AppleScript files
npm run dev      # Watch mode for TypeScript compilation
npm start        # Run the built server
```

### Architecture

- **TypeScript**: Source code in `src/`
- **MCP SDK**: Uses Model Context Protocol for AI integration
- **AppleScript/JXA**: Native OmniFocus interaction via `src/utils/omnifocusScripts/`
- **Tool System**: Modular tools in `src/tools/` with definitions and primitives

## 🧠 How It Works

This server uses AppleScript to communicate with OmniFocus, allowing it to interact with the application's native functionality. The server is built using the Model Context Protocol SDK, which provides a standardized way for AI models to interact with external tools and systems.
